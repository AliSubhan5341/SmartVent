## 1. Project Description

Indoor air quality is directly linked to occupant health, comfort, and productivity. In poorly ventilated environments, elevated carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ) levels and temperature can lead to drowsiness, reduced cognitive function, and general discomfort. This project addresses the need for a smart, automated system that can monitor indoor air quality and proactively control ventilation and cooling mechanisms to maintain a healthy environment.

The core focus of this system is on **CO‚ÇÇ concentration and ambient temperature**, as these are the most immediate indicators of indoor air quality degradation due to human presence and inadequate ventilation. CO‚ÇÇ levels above 1000 ppm are known to negatively impact concentration and decision-making, while temperatures exceeding 26¬∞C can cause thermal discomfort. While humidity is measured, it is not currently a primary driver in decision-making logic.

To address these concerns, the system integrates the following features:

- **Accurate Real-Time Monitoring**: Uses the Adafruit SCD30 sensor to measure CO‚ÇÇ, temperature, and humidity with high precision.
- **Predictive Intelligence**: Employs Holt‚Äôs double exponential smoothing to forecast CO‚ÇÇ and temperature trends several minutes ahead, allowing for proactive environmental control.
- **Smart Actuation**: Based on both real-time and forecasted conditions, the system automatically activates ventilation or cooling systems before thresholds are exceeded.
- **Adaptive Deep Sleep**: Implements a dynamic sleep interval based on the rate of change in CO‚ÇÇ, optimizing power efficiency without compromising responsiveness.
- **Cloud Connectivity**: Publishes data to an MQTT broker for real-time monitoring and logs historical data to InfluxDB for long-term analysis and visualization.
- **State Persistence**: Retains key smoothing and control state across deep sleep cycles using ESP32 RTC memory, ensuring continuity and learning over time.

In summary, this system serves as a low-power, intelligent solution for maintaining healthy indoor air quality. It combines environmental sensing, predictive algorithms, and actuator control to create a feedback loop that optimizes air quality while minimizing unnecessary energy usage.

## 2. Hardware Requirements and Setup

This project uses minimal yet powerful hardware to achieve real-time sensing and control with low power consumption.

### üîß Hardware Components

| Component       | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Heltec ESP32 V3** | Main microcontroller with built-in Wi-Fi and support for deep sleep; compact, reliable, and power-efficient. |
| **Adafruit SCD30 Sensor** | High-accuracy CO‚ÇÇ, temperature, and humidity sensor with I¬≤C communication; ideal for indoor air quality monitoring. |

### üîå Why These Components?

- **Heltec ESP32 V3** supports deep sleep, making it perfect for battery-optimized IoT applications. It also provides built-in USB for programming and debugging.
- **SCD30** provides reliable and precise environmental readings. Its onboard calibration and compensation features improve data quality without extra components.

### üß∞ Wiring Connections

| SCD30 Pin | Heltec ESP32 V3 Pin |
|-----------|---------------------|
| VIN       | 3.3V (or 5V*)        |
| GND       | GND                 |
| SDA       | GPIO 41             |
| SCL       | GPIO 42             |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è *Use 5V if available and compatible; SCD30 works more reliably at 5V even though logic is I¬≤C safe.

## 4. Functional Requirements

This system is designed to intelligently monitor and respond to indoor air quality by combining real-time sensing, forecasting, and adaptive control logic. The following functional requirements define the core behaviors of the system:

|-----------------------------------|-------------|
| **Environmental Sensing**         | Measure CO‚ÇÇ (ppm), temperature (¬∞C), and humidity (%) using the Adafruit SCD30 sensor. |
| **Sensor Stabilization**          | Use a dual-read method to discard the first (often unstable) reading after each wake cycle. |
| **Occupancy Detection**           | Determine if the room is empty by checking if CO‚ÇÇ is below a 500 ppm threshold, and enter longer sleep to conserve energy. |

| **State Persistence**             | Store CO‚ÇÇ, temperature, and trend data in RTC memory to retain forecasting context across deep sleep cycles. |
| **Slope Estimation**              | Calculate the rate of change of CO‚ÇÇ and temperature (in ppm/min and ¬∞C/min) based on time difference between wake cycles. |

| **Adaptive Sleep Duration**       | Dynamically adjust deep sleep interval based on CO‚ÇÇ slope and a predefined drift tolerance to balance accuracy with energy savings. |
| **Fallback Handling**             | Enter a safe default sleep mode when sensor readings fail or valid time isn't available to avoid system crash. |
