## 1. Project Description

Indoor air quality is directly linked to occupant health, comfort, and productivity. In poorly ventilated environments, elevated carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ) levels and temperature can lead to drowsiness, reduced cognitive function, and general discomfort. This project addresses the need for a smart, automated system that can monitor indoor air quality and proactively control ventilation and cooling mechanisms to maintain a healthy environment.

The core focus of this system is on **CO‚ÇÇ concentration and ambient temperature**, as these are the most immediate indicators of indoor air quality degradation due to human presence and inadequate ventilation. CO‚ÇÇ levels above 1000 ppm are known to negatively impact concentration and decision-making, while temperatures exceeding 26¬∞C can cause thermal discomfort. While humidity is measured, it is not currently a primary driver in decision-making logic.

To address these concerns, the system integrates the following features:

- **Accurate Real-Time Monitoring**: Uses the Adafruit SCD30 sensor to measure CO‚ÇÇ, temperature, and humidity with high precision.
- **Predictive Intelligence**: Employs Holt‚Äôs double exponential smoothing to forecast CO‚ÇÇ and temperature trends several minutes ahead, allowing for proactive environmental control.
- **Smart Actuation**: Based on both real-time and forecasted conditions, the system automatically activates ventilation or cooling systems before thresholds are exceeded.
- **Adaptive Deep Sleep**: Implements a dynamic sleep interval based on the rate of change in CO‚ÇÇ, optimizing power efficiency without compromising responsiveness.
- **Cloud Connectivity**: Publishes data to an MQTT broker for real-time monitoring and logs historical data to InfluxDB for long-term analysis and visualization.
- **State Persistence**: Retains key smoothing and control state across deep sleep cycles using ESP32 RTC memory, ensuring continuity and learning over time.

In summary, this system serves as a low-power, intelligent solution for maintaining healthy indoor air quality. It combines environmental sensing, predictive algorithms, and actuator control to create a feedback loop that optimizes air quality while minimizing unnecessary energy usage.

## 4. Functional Requirements

This system is designed to intelligently monitor and respond to indoor air quality by combining real-time sensing, forecasting, and adaptive control logic. The following functional requirements define the core behaviors of the system:

| Requirement                        | Description |
|-----------------------------------|-------------|
| **Environmental Sensing**         | Measure CO‚ÇÇ (ppm), temperature (¬∞C), and humidity (%) using the Adafruit SCD30 sensor. |
| **Sensor Stabilization**          | Use a dual-read method to discard the first (often unstable) reading after each wake cycle. |
| **Occupancy Detection**           | Determine if the room is empty by checking if CO‚ÇÇ is below a 500 ppm threshold, and enter longer sleep to conserve energy. |
| **Time Synchronization**          | Perform one-time NTP sync on first boot to ensure accurate epoch time for trend calculations. |
| **State Persistence**             | Store CO‚ÇÇ, temperature, and trend data in RTC memory to retain forecasting context across deep sleep cycles. |
| **Slope Estimation**              | Calculate the rate of change of CO‚ÇÇ and temperature (in ppm/min and ¬∞C/min) based on time difference between wake cycles. |
| **Forecasting**                   | Use Holt‚Äôs double exponential smoothing to predict CO‚ÇÇ and temperature values a few minutes into the future. |
| **Ventilation & Cooling Control** | Decide whether to turn on ventilation or cooling based on real-time and forecasted air quality. |

| **Adaptive Sleep Duration**       | Dynamically adjust deep sleep interval based on CO‚ÇÇ slope and a predefined drift tolerance to balance accuracy with energy savings. |
| **Fallback Handling**             | Enter a safe default sleep mode when sensor readings fail or valid time isn't available to avoid system crash. |

## 5. How the Code Works

This system follows a structured and power-efficient duty cycle that repeats every time the ESP32 wakes up from deep sleep. The primary purpose is to measure indoor air quality, predict future conditions, and determine whether to simulate actuation (ventilation or cooling) based on those predictions. No physical actuators are connected ‚Äî all control decisions are logged and published for analysis.

### üïì Duty Cycle Overview

Each wake cycle performs the following steps:

1. **Startup & Power Optimization**
   - Serial is initialized for logging.
   - CPU frequency is lowered and Bluetooth is disabled to save power.

2. **Network Connection**
   - Connects to Wi-Fi and MQTT broker.
   - On first boot only, performs an NTP time sync to establish valid system time.

3. **Sensor Reading (SCD30)**
   - The SCD30 sensor is initialized.
   - A **dual-read technique** is used: the first valid reading is discarded, and the second is accepted to ensure stability.
   - CO‚ÇÇ, temperature, and humidity values are stored.

4. **Empty Room Detection**
   - If CO‚ÇÇ < 500 ppm, the room is assumed to be unoccupied.
   - The system enters a long deep sleep (e.g., 20 minutes) to conserve power.

5. **Time & Trend Calculation**
   - The current time is compared with the last recorded time to compute `Œît` (minutes since last wake).
   - Using the current and last CO‚ÇÇ/temperature values, the system calculates slopes (rate of change per minute).

6. **Holt‚Äôs Forecasting**
   - Applies Holt‚Äôs double exponential smoothing to update internal level and trend estimates for both CO‚ÇÇ and temperature.
   - Predicts values `2 minutes` into the future.

7. **Decision Logic (Virtual Actuation)**
   - Based on forecasted values:
     - If predicted CO‚ÇÇ ‚â• 1000 ppm ‚Üí simulate turning **fan ON**
     - If predicted temperature ‚â• 26¬∞C ‚Üí simulate turning **cooling ON**
   - These actions are **not physically executed** but are tracked in flags and published for observation.

8. **Data Publishing**
   - A structured payload is published over MQTT, containing:
     - Current readings
     - Slopes
     - Forecasts
     - Simulated fan/cooling actions
   - The same data is also logged to InfluxDB for visualization and analysis.

9. **Dynamic Deep Sleep Calculation**
   - Using a user-defined `DRIFT_PPM` value (e.g., 50 ppm), the system calculates how long it can sleep before a significant change in CO‚ÇÇ might occur.
   - Sleep duration is bounded between 30 seconds and 15 minutes.

10. **State Persistence**
    - All relevant state variables (last readings, smoothing parameters, time) are stored in RTC memory to persist across sleep cycles.

11. **Deep Sleep**
    - The ESP32 enters deep sleep for the computed duration, cutting power usage to minimal levels.

### üß™ Simulation Mode

- No fans or cooling systems are physically connected.
- Actuator decisions are **logged and published** purely for visualization or future expansion.
- Ideal for testing forecasting logic and system behavior in a virtualized or lab environment.

This approach allows the system to operate autonomously, forecast intelligently, and publish meaningful insights with minimal power consumption ‚Äî ready for real-world deployment with actuators when needed.

## 6. Classroom Testing

To validate system performance in a real-world scenario, we deployed the ESP32 monitor in a classroom and collected CO‚ÇÇ (ppm) and temperature (¬∞C) readings over a school day. The graph below shows how concentrations and ambient temperature evolved, with class periods (12:00‚Äì14:00 and 15:00‚Äì17:00) shaded in gray.

![CO‚ÇÇ and Temperature Readings (with Class Periods Shaded)](trends.png)

**Observations:**
- **Morning (11:00‚Äì12:00):** CO‚ÇÇ remains low (~580‚Äì630 ppm) before students arrive; temperature gradually rises from ~27.5 ¬∞C to ~28.5 ¬∞C.
- **First Class (12:00‚Äì14:00):** CO‚ÇÇ spikes above 1200 ppm, indicating high occupancy and limited ventilation; temperature continues rising up to ~30 ¬∞C.
- **Break (14:00‚Äì15:00):** CO‚ÇÇ drops back towards ~630 ppm as students leave; temperature peaks around 30.2 ¬∞C then stabilizes.
- **Second Class (15:00‚Äì17:00):** CO‚ÇÇ again climbs above 1100 ppm; temperature slowly declines from ~30.5 ¬∞C to ~28.5 ¬∞C, reflecting HVAC or window adjustments.
- **End of Day (17:00‚Äì18:00):** CO‚ÇÇ and temperature both decrease towards baseline.

This test demonstrates the system‚Äôs ability to track rapid changes in air quality during occupied periods, providing both real-time data and context for proactive ventilation control.
