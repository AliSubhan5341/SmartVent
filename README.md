## 1. Project Description

Indoor air quality is directly linked to occupant health, comfort, and productivity. In poorly ventilated environments, elevated carbon dioxide (CO₂) levels and temperature can lead to drowsiness, reduced cognitive function, and general discomfort. This project addresses the need for a smart, automated system that can monitor indoor air quality and proactively control ventilation and cooling mechanisms to maintain a healthy environment.

The core focus of this system is on **CO₂ concentration and ambient temperature**, as these are the most immediate indicators of indoor air quality degradation due to human presence and inadequate ventilation. CO₂ levels above 1000 ppm are known to negatively impact concentration and decision-making, while temperatures exceeding 26°C can cause thermal discomfort. While humidity is measured, it is not currently a primary driver in decision-making logic.

To address these concerns, the system integrates the following features:

- **Accurate Real-Time Monitoring**: Uses the Adafruit SCD30 sensor to measure CO₂, temperature, and humidity with high precision.
- **Predictive Intelligence**: Employs Holt’s double exponential smoothing to forecast CO₂ and temperature trends several minutes ahead, allowing for proactive environmental control.
- **Smart Actuation**: Based on both real-time and forecasted conditions, the system automatically activates ventilation or cooling systems before thresholds are exceeded.
- **Adaptive Deep Sleep**: Implements a dynamic sleep interval based on the rate of change in CO₂, optimizing power efficiency without compromising responsiveness.
- **Cloud Connectivity**: Publishes data to an MQTT broker for real-time monitoring and logs historical data to InfluxDB for long-term analysis and visualization.
- **State Persistence**: Retains key smoothing and control state across deep sleep cycles using ESP32 RTC memory, ensuring continuity and learning over time.

In summary, this system serves as a low-power, intelligent solution for maintaining healthy indoor air quality. It combines environmental sensing, predictive algorithms, and actuator control to create a feedback loop that optimizes air quality while minimizing unnecessary energy usage.

## 2. Hardware Requirements and Setup

This project uses minimal yet powerful hardware to achieve real-time sensing and control with low power consumption.

### 🔧 Hardware Components

| Component       | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Heltec ESP32 V3** | Main microcontroller with built-in Wi-Fi and support for deep sleep; compact, reliable, and power-efficient. |
| **Adafruit SCD30 Sensor** | High-accuracy CO₂, temperature, and humidity sensor with I²C communication; ideal for indoor air quality monitoring. |

### 🔌 Why These Components?

- **Heltec ESP32 V3** supports deep sleep, making it perfect for battery-optimized IoT applications. It also provides built-in USB for programming and debugging.
- **SCD30** provides reliable and precise environmental readings. Its onboard calibration and compensation features improve data quality without extra components.

### 🧰 Wiring Connections

| SCD30 Pin | Heltec ESP32 V3 Pin |
|-----------|---------------------|
| VIN       | 3.3V (or 5V*)        |
| GND       | GND                 |
| SDA       | GPIO 41             |
| SCL       | GPIO 42             |

> ⚠️ *Use 5V if available and compatible; SCD30 works more reliably at 5V even though logic is I²C safe.
